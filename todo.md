## general research
* Find better js and css cache busting
  * maybe shorttag inspired by [cache buster plugin](https://github.com/mightyplow/eleventy-plugin-cache-buster)
* Responsive images (https://github.com/nhoizey/images-responsiver), CDN?
* form transitions (error messages, success message)
* woff2 and preload
* PWA
    
## just do it
* no js navigation for small devices

## life quality tasks
* better pre commit (lint-staged?)

## content
* garden
    - water
        - animated logo instead of text?
        - parallax effect for camera
    - L-system

## new structure redesign
- new logo
- bigger space between sections
- menu items 
- smooth scroll
- redirects from old routes
- sections bakground image?
